    <h3 style="color: red; font-style:italic ;">What is CSS</h3>
    <ol type="1" class="ol1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="line">Css is not necessary</span> <span style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work,</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="head3">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span style=background-color:yellow>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies to style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
